# Website Usability Audit

**Target**: $ARGUMENTS

Conducts focused usability audits and generates implementable UX fixes.
Complements `auditing-website-accessibility` (WCAG compliance) with
UX-focused analysis. No overlap: accessibility handles ARIA/contrast/keyboard;
this handles task completion, friction, and clarity.

## Audit Areas

### Forms

- Smart defaults and field reduction
- Logical grouping and progressive disclosure
- Inline validation with helpful messaging

### Navigation

- Information architecture and menu depth (target: <3 levels)
- Mobile usability and touch targets
- Breadcrumbs, search, and task completion paths

### Input Validation

- Real-time feedback and error prevention
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance
- Submission confirmation

### Microcopy

- Button labels, form hints, and instructional text
- Error message clarity and actionability
- User confidence messaging

## Workflow

1. **Identify scope** from $ARGUMENTS (URL, file, or directory)
2. **Audit task flows** - map primary user journeys, identify friction
3. **Inspect forms** - field count, grouping, validation behavior
4. **Review navigation** - menu depth, mobile patterns, findability
5. **Evaluate microcopy** - labels, errors, guidance text
6. **Classify findings** by impact on task completion
7. **Generate fixes** with specific code changes

## Output Format

### Findings

```text
CRITICAL (Task Completion Blockers)
- [Issue] - Impact: [High/Medium/Low] - Element: [selector]
  Fix: [Specific code/design change]
  Metric: [What improves - conversion, completion, error rate]

OPTIMIZATIONS (Friction Reduction)
- [Issue] - Impact: [High/Medium/Low] - Element: [selector]
  Fix: [Specific code/design change]
  Metric: [What improves]
```

### Implementation Checklist

```text
- [ ] [Fix description] - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
```

Group fixes by: Forms, Navigation, Validation, Microcopy.

## Rules

- Prioritize task-completion blockers before friction reduction
- Every finding must include a specific, implementable fix
- No time estimates -- prioritize by impact only
- Defer WCAG/accessibility concerns to `auditing-website-accessibility`
- Keep output concise: findings + fixes + checklist only
