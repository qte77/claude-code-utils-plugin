# Context Compaction (ACE-FCA)

Distills verbose outputs into structured summaries following ACE-FCA principles.

## When to Use

Per `references/context-management.md`:

- After verbose tool output (logs, JSON, search results)
- After completing a phase or milestone

## Workflow

1. **Identify noise** - What pollution sources need compacting?
2. **Extract signal** - Correct + Complete info only
3. **Structure output** - Use template format below

## Output Template

```markdown
# Compaction: {{name}}

## Trajectory
<!-- Research status → Planning status → Implementation status -->

## Key Files
<!-- files touched with purpose -->

## Completed
<!-- done items -->

## Blockers
<!-- blocking issues (empty if none) -->

## Findings
<!-- key discoveries, distilled outputs from logs/JSON/tests -->
```

## Quality Check

- Correct > Complete > Minimal
- No raw dumps, only structured summaries
- Enough to continue, no more
- Update working plan with compaction output (don't orphan it)
