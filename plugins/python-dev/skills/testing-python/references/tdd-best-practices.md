**Purpose**: How to do TDD - Red-Green-Refactor cycle, AAA structure,
best practices, anti-patterns.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a development methodology where tests are written before
implementation code, driving design and ensuring testability from the
start.

## The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

```text
┌─────────────┐
│  1. RED     │  Write a failing test
│             │  (test what should happen)
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  2. GREEN   │  Write minimal code to pass
│             │  (make it work)
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  3. REFACTOR│  Improve code quality
│             │  (make it clean)
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      └──────> Repeat
```

## Core Practices

### 1. Write Tests First

**Why**: Enforces modular, decoupled code with clear interfaces

```python
# RED: Write failing test first
def test_user_service_creates_new_user():
    service = UserService()
    user = service.create(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
    assert user.id is not None
    assert user.name == "Alice"
```

**Then** implement minimal code to pass.

### 2. Use Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)

Structure every test in three phases:

```python
def test_order_processor_calculates_total():
    # ARRANGE - Set up test data
    items = [Item(price=10.00, qty=2), Item(price=5.00, qty=1)]
    processor = OrderProcessor()

    # ACT - Execute the behavior
    total = processor.calculate_total(items)

    # ASSERT - Verify the outcome
    assert total == 25.00
```

### 3. Keep Tests Atomic and Isolated

**One behavior per test**: `test_calculator_adds_numbers()` tests
addition only, not subtraction, multiplication, etc.

### 4. Test Edge Cases Before Happy Paths

Cover failure modes first (empty input, malformed data), then success
cases.

### 5. Descriptive Test Names

Name describes behavior: `test_user_service_returns_404_for_unknown_user()`
not `test_service_response()`.

## Benefits of TDD

**Design quality**: Forces modular, testable code with clear interfaces

**Fast feedback**: Catches bugs immediately while context is fresh

**Refactoring confidence**: Tests enable safe code improvements

**Living documentation**: Tests describe how the system behaves

**Defect reduction**: Studies show 40-90% reduction in defect density

## TDD Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Testing implementation details**:

```python
# BAD - Tests internal structure
def test_service_uses_specific_library():
    assert isinstance(service._internal_client, SomeLibrary)

# GOOD - Tests behavior
def test_service_fetches_data():
    assert service.fetch("key") == expected_value
```

**Unspec'd mocks on third-party types**: `MagicMock()` silently accepts any
attribute, masking API drift bugs until runtime.

```python
# BAD - mock.data always succeeds even if AgentRunResult has no .data
mock_result = MagicMock()
result = await run_manager(...)  # passes, but crashes at runtime

# GOOD - spec= constrains to real interface
mock_result = MagicMock(spec=AgentRunResult)
mock_result.output = MagicMock()  # must explicitly set dataclass fields
```

**Overly complex tests**: If test setup is harder to understand than
the code, simplify. Avoid excessive mocking.

**Chasing 100% coverage**: Aim for meaningful behavior coverage, not
line coverage percentage.

**Stale fixture patches**: When source code changes (renamed imports,
restructured modules), update or delete tests that patch the old
interface. Broken fixtures don't clean up properly, leaving shared
state dirty and causing unrelated tests to fail later in the suite.

**Low-value patterns**: See `testing-strategy.md` → "Patterns to Remove"
for full list.

## Running Tests

See the project's CONTRIBUTING.md for all make recipes and test commands.

For TDD iterations, run specific tests with
`uv run pytest tests/test_module.py::test_function`.

## When to Use TDD

**Use TDD for**:

- Business logic (calculations, algorithms, rules)
- Data transformations (model conversions, parsing)
- Edge case handling (empty inputs, nulls, boundaries)
- API endpoints (request/response validation)

**Consider alternatives for**:

- Simple CRUD operations
- UI layouts (use visual testing)
- Exploratory prototypes (add tests after)
