Based on [OWASP MAESTRO
v1.0](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/multi-agentic-system-threat-modeling-guide-v1-0/)
-- a 7-layer threat modeling framework for multi-agent systems.

## MAESTRO Layers

| Layer | Focus | Key Concern |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1. Model | LLM security | Prompt injection, data leakage |
| 2. Agent Logic | Agent behavior | Input validation, type safety |
| 3. Integration | External services | Service failures, API key exposure |
| 4. Monitoring | Observability | Log injection, sensitive data in traces |
| 5. Execution | Runtime safety | Resource exhaustion, race conditions |
| 6. Environment | Infrastructure | Container isolation, secret mgmt |
| 7. Orchestration | Coordination | Registration hijacking, exec order |

## Layer Threats and Mitigations

### Layer 1: Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Prompt injection | Structured outputs with schema validation |
| Model poisoning | Provider abstraction; no direct model API calls |
| Data leakage | Output validation; content filtering |

### Layer 2: Agent Logic

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Unvalidated inputs | Typed models at all component boundaries |
| Type confusion | ABC/interface contracts enforcing signatures |
| Logic bugs in coordination | Explicit typed context passing |

### Layer 3: Integration

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Service downtime cascade | Timeouts; graceful degradation w/ partials |
| API key leakage | Credentials from env vars (12-Factor #3) |
| Compromised external service | Rate limits; circuit breakers; retry/backoff |

### Layer 4: Monitoring

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Log injection | Structured logging; no string interpolation |
| Trace data tampering | Immutable event streams; append-only stores |
| Sensitive data in logs | No PII in default output; log sanitization |

### Layer 5: Execution

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Resource exhaustion | Per-component timeouts; memory limits |
| Infinite loops | Timeout enforcement; bounded iteration |
| Race conditions | Stateless design; thread-safe external stores |

### Layer 6: Environment

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Container escape | Non-root execution; read-only filesystems |
| Secret exposure | `.env` excluded from VCS; external vault |
| Network attacks | Network segmentation; minimal exposed ports |

### Layer 7: Orchestration

| Threat | Mitigation |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Registration hijacking | Static imports; no dynamic plugin loading |
| Execution order tampering | Explicit ordering in code, not configuration |
| Unauthorized components | Allowlists; signature verification |

## Threat Matrix Template

| Layer | Component | Threat | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1 (Model) | LLM caller | Prompt injection | HIGH | Structured out | |
| 2 (Logic) | Agent interface | Type confusion | MED | Schema valid | |
| 3 (Integration) | External APIs | Service down | MED | Graceful degrade | |
| 4 (Monitoring) | Trace store | Log injection | MED | Structured log | |
| 5 (Execution) | Runner | Resource exhaust | HIGH | Timeouts | |
| 6 (Environment) | Infrastructure | Secret exposure | HIGH | Env var mgmt | |
| 7 (Orchestration) | Registry | Unauthorized | MED | Static imports | |

## Security Checklist

For design quality checks, see the [Design
Checklist](mas-design-principles.md#agentplugin-design-checklist).

### Input Validation

- [ ] All inputs validated via typed model schema
- [ ] String inputs sanitized (no code injection)
- [ ] Numeric inputs range-checked
- [ ] File paths validated (no directory traversal)

### Output Safety

- [ ] Outputs use typed validated models
- [ ] No sensitive data in outputs (PII, API keys)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak internal state
- [ ] Structured errors for graceful degradation

### Resource Management

- [ ] Timeouts configured per component
- [ ] Memory usage bounded (no unbounded collections/loops)
- [ ] File descriptors properly closed
- [ ] Network connections have timeouts

### Observability

- [ ] Structured logging with context
- [ ] Trace events emitted for debugging
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Error paths logged for audit

### External Dependencies

- [ ] API keys from environment variables
- [ ] External service failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Circuit breaker for cascading failures
